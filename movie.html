      	<p>Violet is the princess of a kingdom in a world that connects with other worlds and trespasses
	   the borders of time and place. She brings into her world positive and strong energy; because of 
	   her personality, she always wants to help others and make them understand that you have to keep 
	   fighting.
	   Therefore this music video pretends to show violet's dynamism and interaction with San Marino's world.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The artistic inspiration for this project was video games like Prince of Persia or Onigiri.  I was 
	   really interested in the possibility to travel in time and to other worlds. Also, I made this idea 
	   my own through the design of the world because I tried to combine two different ages (Medieval and Modern) 
	   with the possibility to find different worlds and other epochs in the story. 
           I chose to make my final work a music video about Violet's personality, lifestyle and likes represented 
	   through pieces of art, colors, sounds, and effects. 
           For this project, I superimposed an image of my character on a video to add movement, applied effects, 
	   brushes, and masks to color a photograph, arranged instrument sounds with effects to create a track, 
	   applied text animation with masks, and used the repeater to create a pattern. 
           Finally, the final file slightly changed from the original storyboard. I  removed the image of the ocean and 
	   replace it with one of a mysterious forest made by hand that I added at the end of the music video as a background.</p>
