	<p>The character's environment sounds like a mix of classical music and some modern 
	   sounds from pop, rock, and skate punk as well as contemporary instruments and 
	   beeps; because it's a world inside of a video game that does not have an end and the 
           story hasn't been written yet.
	   <br>
	   Between the dances, we will find waltz, pop, and rock & roll.
           This character doesn't live alone in the world, she lives in a world with a kingdom, so 
           she is surrounded by persons with appearances from the middle age as well as 
	   modern style; because in this kingdom there is a portal that allows people to travel 
	   across time and place to new worlds even centuries later.
	   <br>
	   She decided to live in the kingdom as a temporary residence, especially for slowing 
    	   down her life, and every time that she needs a break from her modern world; 
	   nevertheless, she frequently visits the new worlds because her main residence is 
           there, and she lives alone.
	   <br>
	   About the weather, It is tropical in the south part of the world but on the north side, we 
           will find the four seasons.
	   <br>
	   Finally, in her daily life we will find the sounds from nature, the bells outside the doors 
	   of the houses, the big bell sound from the castle marking the time and the beeps, 
	   sounds from the technology and the city once she or people crossed the portal to the 
	   future.</p>
