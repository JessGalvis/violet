	<p>Violet is very artistic, funny, and smart. She looks cute and she can 
	be cute but at the same time, she has a strong personality that identifies her. Also, she 
	is very brave, determined, disciplined, loyal, competitive, and honest. 
	About her way to move, she moves always in a straight direction; she thinks that you 
	have to solve the problem from the root and without anesthesia.</p>
